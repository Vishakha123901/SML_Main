# Firestore Security Rules - Confirmed

Your Firestore rules are already correctly configured for the gallery collection:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /blogs/{blogPostId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /gallery/{itemId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Status: âœ… Ready to Use
- The `gallery` collection is properly configured
- Public read access for displaying media on website
- Authenticated write access for CMS management
- No changes needed to existing `products` and `blogs` collections

The media gallery CMS will now store and retrieve data from the `gallery` collection as specified in your rules.
